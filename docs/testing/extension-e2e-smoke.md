# Extension E2E Smoke Suite

This suite is the minimum release-candidate confidence gate for the extension wallet.

## Coverage

- Onboarding: welcome screen at `/onboarding` and create-wallet flow starts
- Lock/Unlock: locked wallet unlocks to `home`
- Send/Receive: core transfer screens are reachable
- Session Keys: unlocked access allowed, logged-out access blocked

## Determinism Guarantees

- Stable auth fixtures seeded directly into `localStorage` (`tests/fixtures/extension.ts`)
- Fixed clock per test via `freezeTime()` to avoid timing drift
- No remote dependencies required for smoke assertions
- Single tagged test target (`@smoke`) to keep suite scope explicit

## Local Runner

From the `apps/extension-wallet` directory:

```bash
# Short alias — runs @smoke-tagged tests on chromium and firefox
pnpm e2e

# Full suite (all specs, both browsers)
pnpm test:e2e

# Smoke only, explicit
pnpm test:e2e:smoke
```

From repository root (via turbo):

```bash
pnpm --filter @ancore/extension-wallet e2e
```

Debug mode (headed, single worker, trace on):

```bash
pnpm test:e2e:smoke:debug
```

## Debugging Tips

- If selectors fail, inspect current route and assert URL first before UI expectations.
- Keep smoke assertions focused on user-critical outcomes, not full-page snapshots.
- Prefer fixture seeding over multi-step setup when reproducing a failure quickly.
- Use Playwright traces from debug mode to inspect exact action timing and DOM state.

## CI Integration

- Pull request and branch CI runs `Extension E2E Smoke` as a browser matrix (`chromium`, `firefox`).
- Release gate includes `[Gate 6] Extension E2E Smoke`.
- Any failure blocks release gate completion unless a manual override is explicitly used for other failing gates.
